# Modifying a final variable in Dart

This code demonstrates an attempt to modify a `final` variable in Dart after its initialization.  The `final` keyword indicates that a variable can only be assigned a value once.  Attempting to reassign it will result in a runtime error.

The solution demonstrates how to use a mutable variable (without `final` or `const`) when the value needs to be changed after initialization.
